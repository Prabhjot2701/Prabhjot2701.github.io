                <p class="para">There are few projects and labs that I have made during my university and college time.<br>
                Below is the glimpse of few of my works:<br> </p> 
                <ol id="project">
                    <li>
                        The first project that I made was <i>Intranet Email System</i> in 2015 and this was designed using PHP,HTML and CSS.<br><br>
                         This system facilitates the mailing service for teachers and students. Teachers can send mail to one student or group and even students can do the same.<br><br>

                        <img src="img/project5.jpg" alt="mail frame" class="col-d-3 col-t-3">

                    <li>
                            My second project is coded in Java and it is <i>Exam Module</i>, designed for computerized tests for different subjects on the scheduled day. The student needs to enter the student number and password and can take the test. <br>No student can retake the test and if the student tries to attempt the exam again, then window displaying message that <i>Test already attempted</i> will be displayed.<br> Neither the student can attempt test before the scheduled exam day.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The next project (<i>Heart Disease prediction </i>) is also coded in Java and is based on Data Mining concept(Naive Bayes). The project is designed from the begineer's prospective. <br>The user needs to enter data to check whether he/she has possibility to have heart disease in future or not. <br>The prediction is done on basis of already stored data of the heart patients.
